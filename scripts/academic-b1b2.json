      "## Academic English\n## Academic Argumentation Techniques\n## B1/B2\n\n### Warm up\n- **Welcome** to the lesson on *Academic Argumentation Techniques*!\n- Let's start with a quick *discussion*:\n  - What do you think *argumentation* means in an academic context?\n  - Have you ever had to *argue* a point in a paper or presentation?\n\n### Key Concepts\n- **Argumentation** is the process of *presenting reasons* to support or refute a claim.\n- **Claims** are statements that assert something to be true.\n- **Evidence** includes *facts*, *statistics*, and *examples* that support the claim.\n- **Reasoning** links the evidence to the claim, showing why the evidence supports the claim.\n\n### Types of Arguments\n- **Deductive Arguments**: Start with a general statement and reach a specific conclusion.\n  - Example: *All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.*\n- **Inductive Arguments**: Start with specific observations and reach a general conclusion.\n  - Example: *Every swan we've seen is white. Therefore, all swans are probably white.*\n\n### Structure of an Argument\n- **Introduction**: Present the *claim* or *thesis*.\n- **Body Paragraphs**: Each paragraph should include:\n  - A *topic sentence* that introduces the main idea.\n  - *Evidence* to support the main idea.\n  - *Reasoning* to explain how the evidence supports the main idea.\n- **Conclusion**: Summarize the argument and restate the claim.\n\n### Common Logical Fallacies\n- **Ad Hominem**: Attacking the person instead of the argument.\n- **Straw Man**: Misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack.\n- **Hasty Generalization**: Making a general statement based on insufficient evidence.\n- **False Dilemma**: Presenting two options as the only possibilities when more exist.\n\n### Practice Activity\n- Read the following argument and identify any logical fallacies:\n  > *\"We should not listen to John's argument on climate change because he is not a scientist.\"*\n- Discuss with a partner:\n  - What type of fallacy is present?\n  - How could the argument be improved?\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Review**: Today we learned about the structure of an argument, types of arguments, and common logical fallacies.\n- **Homework**: Write a short argument on a topic of your choice, using the techniques discussed in this lesson.\n- **Questions**: Do you have any questions about today's lesson?\n\n### Additional Resources\n- For more information on academic argumentation, visit [Purdue OWL](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/logic_in_argumentative_writing.html).\n- To practice identifying logical fallacies, check out [Your Logical Fallacy Is](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/).\n\n### Image\n- ![Academic Argumentation](https://example.com/academic_argumentation.jpg)",
